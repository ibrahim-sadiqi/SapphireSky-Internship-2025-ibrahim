1. What is a linked list, and how does it differ from an array?

The major difference between Array and Linked list regards to their structure.
Arrays are Index based data structure where each element associated with an index.
On the other hand, Linked list relies on references where each node consists of the data and the references to the previous and next element.
Basically, an array is a set of similar data objects stored in sequential memory locations under a common heading or a variable name. While a linked list is a data structure which
contains a sequence of the elements where each element is linked to its next element.
There are two fields in an element of linked list. One is Data field, and other is link field,
Data field contains the actual value to be stored
