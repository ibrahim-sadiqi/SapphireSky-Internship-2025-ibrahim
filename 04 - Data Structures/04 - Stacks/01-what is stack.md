1. What is a stack, and how does it follow the LIFO principle?
   A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. This means that elements are added and removed from the top of the stack, just like a stack of plates—where the last plate placed on top is the first one to be removed.

   Stacks can be implemented in two ways:

   1. Fixed-size stacks – Implemented using arrays.
   2. Dynamic-size stacks – Implemented using linked lists, allowing flexible memory usage.
