1. What is a queue, and how does it follow the FIFO principle?
   A Queue is a type of data structure used to store and manage data in a specific order, similar to a stack. However, unlike a stack, which follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, a queue operates on the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed, similar to a line of people where the person who arrives first gets served first.
   In computing, queues are widely used for task scheduling, instruction processing, and managing resources in operating systems and networks.
