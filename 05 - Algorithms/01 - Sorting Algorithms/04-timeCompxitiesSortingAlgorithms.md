4. Compare the time complexities of different sorting algorithms.

   1. bubble sort this algorthim less efficient algorithm that in average case and worst case it has time complexity O(n^2) and just in best case time complexity is O(n) it has more swaping and make it less efficient.

   2. Selection sort like bubble sort it also has time complexity O(n^2) unlike bubble sort in best case time complexity is O(n^2) and one features it has and make a little efficient than bubble sort swapping it has O(n) swapping.

   3. Insertion sort time complexity is worst case and average case is O(n^2) and best case is O(n) and it is more efficient then bubble sort and selection sort that it doesn't have swapping and all of them don't have space complexity.

   4. Merge sort: It uses divide-and-conquer algorithm and time complexity is O(n log n) in all case, but but need extra space during sorting that is space complexity is O(n)

   5. Quick sort: This algorithm also use divide-and-conquer algorithm and time complexity is in base and average case are O(n log n), but in worst case is O(n^2), meanwhile in space complexity is O(n log n).

   6. Heap sort: This is an in-place algorithm which space complexity is O(1) and time complexity is O(n log n) in all cases.

   7. Redix sort is an integer sorting algorithm which time complexiy in all cases are O(nk) and space complexity is O(n + k)

   8. Couting sort: used integer sorting algorithm which time complexity in all cases are O(n + k) and space complexity is O(k).

   9. Bucket sort: used insertion sort algorithm wich time coplexity in worst case is O(n^2) and bast and average case are O(n + k) and space complexity is O(n + k).

   10. Time sort : It is a hybrid sorting algorithm uses Merge sort for stability and performance on large datasets and Insertion sort for efficeincy on smalls or mostly sorted parts which time complexity is O(n) in the best case and O(n log n) in the worst and average cases, and whose space complexity is O(n).
